# Data Hiding and Data Protection of Patientsâ€™ records in a Multi-Specialty Hospital

In the last 20 years, the healthcare industry hasseen a significant increase in the use of medical informationand its applications. In order to deliver top-notch healthcareservices on a worldwide scale, the ability to access patientinformation utilizing web-based technologies from any place isbecoming increasingly important. Medical data communicatedover open networks must be protected in the current era,especially when important considerations like patientconfidentiality are taken into account. Particularly sensitive,patient medical information requires the highest level ofsecurity during both storage and transfer. Linking theserecords to patient medical information, such as X-ray or scanimages, is frequently necessary (CAT, MRI, etc.). We plan toemploy LSB-based image steganography for data concealmentand cryptography (the AES approach) for data encryption,even though there are a number of security solutions that can encrypt the information and prevent unauthorized access tothe data.
